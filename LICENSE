REFERENCE DESIGN FILES LICENSE AGREEMENT
        
This Microchip RDF License Agreement ("License") is a contract between you, your heirs, successors and assigns ("Licensee") and Microchip Technology Incorporated, a Delaware corporation, with a principal place of business at 2355 W. Chandler Blvd., Chandler, AZ 85224-6199, and its subsidiaries including Microchip Technology Ireland Limited (collectively, "Microchip") for the Microchip reference design files (or any of them), accompanying documentation, images or other graphic resources as made available under this License by Microchip (collectively, the �RDF"), as may be revised from time to time by Microchip at its discretion.
    
	1. License Grant.  Microchip grants to Licensee a non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, worldwide license to use and revise the RDF (but to not sub-license or distribute) and adaptations and derivatives of the RDF made by Licensee as 3D models for use in connection with Microchip�s products (or Licensee�s products that use or incorporate Microchip�s products), at all times subject to the terms of section 2 and to Licensee�s compliance with the terms of this License. 
   
	2. Third Party Licenses. (A) Third Party Components. Licensee accepts that it alone is responsible for complying with third party license terms and requirements applicable to the use of third party technology, specifications or systems (which may, without limitation, include requirements of standards setting organizations), and Licensee agrees to comply with the foregoing to the extent relevant hereto.  Microchip is not responsible and shall not be in any way liable for Licensee�s failure to comply with applicable third party license terms or requirements. (B) Open Source Components. Licensee further accepts that components of the RDF may be covered by so-called "open source" licenses ("Open Source Components", namely  licenses approved as open source licenses by the Open Source Initiative or any substantially similar licenses, including without limitation any license that requires that product be made available in source code format as a condition of distribution of the technology licensed under such license). To the extent required by the open source licenses, the terms of such licenses will apply to such Open Source Components in lieu of the terms of this License, and restrictions in this License will not apply with respect to such Open Source Components to the extent that such licenses prohibit such restrictions.
    
	3. Licensee Obligations.  Licensee will not: (a) engage in unauthorized use, modification, disclosure or distribution of the RDF (or any adaptations or derivatives); (b) use the RDF or any part of them, or any adaptations or derivatives, except in conjunction with Microchip�s products (or Licensee�s products, as provided in section 1 above) as set forth in this License; or (c) reverse engineer (by disassembly, decompiling or otherwise) the RDF or any portion thereof.  Licensee must not remove or alter any Microchip copyright or other proprietary rights notice posted in any portion of the RDF. Licensee will defend, indemnify and hold Microchip and its subsidiaries harmless from and against any and all claims, costs, damages, expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees), liabilities, and losses, including without limitation: (i) any claims directly or indirectly arising from or related to the use, modification, disclosure or distribution of the RDF (or of any adaptation or derivative), or any intellectual property rights related thereto; (ii) the use, sale and distribution of Licensee�s products; and (iii) breach of this License. 
 
	4. Confidentiality.  Licensee agrees that the RDF (in any form), its adaptations and derivatives, and underlying technology, inventions, know-how and ideas relating to the RDF, comprise proprietary information belonging to Microchip and its licensors ("Proprietary Information").  Except as expressly and unambiguously allowed herein, Licensee will hold in confidence and not use or disclose any Proprietary Information and will similarly bind in writing its employees, consultants and other persons to whom it makes any of the foregoing available whether directly or indirectly.  Proprietary Information will not include information that (i) is in or enters the public domain without breach of this License and through no fault of the receiving party; (ii) the receiving party was legally in possession of prior to receiving it; (iii) the receiving party can demonstrate was developed by the receiving party independently and without use of or reference to the disclosing party's Proprietary Information; or (iv) the receiving party receives from a third party without restriction on disclosure.  If Licensee is required to disclose Proprietary Information by law, court order, or government agency, Licensee will give Microchip prompt notice of such requirement in order to allow Microchip to object or limit such disclosure.  Licensee agrees that the provisions of this License regarding unauthorized use and nondisclosure are necessary to protect the legitimate business interests of Microchip and its licensors and that monetary damage alone cannot adequately compensate Microchip or its licensors if such provisions are violated.  Licensee therefore agrees that if Microchip alleges that Licensee or any person has breached or violated such provision then Microchip will have the right to injunctive relief, without the requirement for the posting of a bond, in addition to all other remedies at law or in equity.
    
	5. Ownership and Retention of Rights.  Microchip and its licensors retain all right, title and interest in and to the RDF and its underlying technology, and any copies, adaptations and derivatives (by whomever produced), including, without limitation, all patent, copyright, trade secret, know-how and other intellectual property rights in and to the RDF. Use of the RDF, adaptations and derivatives is limited to the license rights described in this License, and Licensee�s rights with respect to the them are limited to the licenses expressly set forth herein and subject to the conditions hereof. 
    
	6. Termination of License.  Without prejudice to any other rights, this License terminates immediately, without notice by Microchip, upon a failure by Licensee, its employees, consultants or agents to comply with any provision of this License. Microchip may terminate this License immediately, for any reason, by written or oral notice to Licensee. Upon termination, Licensee must wil immediately stop using the RDF, adaptations and derivatives thereof, and promptly destroy or delete them from its systems.
    
	7. Consumers � Applicable Terms.

The RDF are made available to Licensee free of charge, and Licensee may at any time download further copies without charge to replace the RDF initially downloaded. In all the circumstances, to the extent that liability may lawfully be limited or excluded, the cumulative liability of Microchip and its licensors will not exceed USD$1,000 (or equivalent sum in the currency of the country in which Consumer resides). However, none of the foregoing shall limit or exclude any liability for death or personal injury arising from negligence, or for fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation or any other cause that by law cannot be excluded and limited.
    
	8. Warranty Disclaimers.  EXCEPT FOR CONSUMERS TO WHOM SECTION 7 APPLIES, THE RDF ARE PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND MICROCHIP AND ITS LICENSORS ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE ACCURACY, RELIABILITY OR APPLICATION OF THE RDF OR ANY PART OF THEM.  MICROCHIP AND ITS LICENSORS DO NOT WARRANT THAT THE RDF WILL MEET REQUIREMENTS OF LICENSEE OR THIRD PARTY, BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE.
